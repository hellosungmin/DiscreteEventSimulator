#Discrete Event Simulator

Discrete event systems (e.g. manufacturing system) can be modeled with an event graph.

Key event graph models are implemented through this project. 


## Usage

Users can:

     1 : Select an event graph model
     
     2 : Input statistical conditions
     
     3 : Output statistical report
     
     
## Class diagram
Classes can grouped into 4 parts :
  
        1 : Individual Event-based Model 
        
        After "Fetch" cycle retrieves next event from FutureEventList, the  "Execution" cycle begins.
        
             - EventBasedModel            // Base class for individual models below
             - SingleServer                 
             - FlexibleMultiserver          
             - LimitedWaitingSpace         
             - BatchedService               
             - TandemLine
   
         2 : FutureEventList
         
            - FutureEvetList
            - FutureEvent
  
         3 : Interarrival time/Service time generator
         
         Generates random numbers needed in "Execution" cycle.
         
             - InterarrivalGenerator 
             - ServiceGenerator

         4 : Statistical Accumulators
         
         Event type is passed by individual model during "Execution" cycle. When the simulation is terminated,
         EntityManager returns statistical informations.
         
             - EntityManager
             - Entity
